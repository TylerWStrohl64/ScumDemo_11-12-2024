	 * Card Stack
	 *  Track if a player layed down 2 of a card or 3 of a card or 1 of a card. / play multiple cards.
	 * 
	 * Player Rotation
	 *  There should be a boolean value for the player and each AI that gets flipped to true when they're out
	 * 	that goes in the appropriate spot in the boolean array. game ends when all are flipped to true.
	 * 
	 * Passing & Rounds
	 * 		Player Rotation.
	 * 
	 * Finish a Game
